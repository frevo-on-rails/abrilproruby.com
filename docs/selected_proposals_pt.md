Segregação Incremental em Rails

### Talk Description
Testar é difícil. Testar uma aplicação Rails é ainda mais difícil. Aplicações Rails tendem a misturar lógica de negócios com lógica do framework, fazendo os testes carregaram um monte de código do framework só para testar pequenos pedaços de funcionalidade. O resultado é que os testes são lentos, desenvolvedores rodam os testes com menos frequência e o ciclo vermelho/verde/refatorar é quebrado.

Existem muitas soluções para o problema de fusão do código da aplicação com o framework, mas muitas precisam de um grande compromisso arquitetural. Se você tem uma aplicação que precisa de ajuda, então você está sem sorte.

Nessa apresentação, nós vamos falar de uma abordagem para segregar a aplicação e o framework, uma abordagem que possa ser aplicada incrementalmente a aplicações existentes com sucesso. Vamos examinar dicas e técnicas para manter seus testes de feedback rápido livres de preocupações do framework, e para lidar com o problema de controladores gordos sem criar modelos gordos. No fim, vamos usar Rails pelo que ele faz melhor, sem dificultar o uso do ciclo de feedback rápido do TDD.

Rails: As Partes Escondidas

### Talk Description
O framework Rails contem um conjunto de recursos úteis para toda aplicação web, mas nem todo recurso está bem implementado e sem bugs.

Durante a palestra, nós vamos passar por dois recursos muito antigos de Rails - os scopes de Active Record e a sanitização de HTML - e explicar como eles funcionam por baixo dos panos. Também vão ser apresentadas os problemas atuais que estamos enfrentando e como eles podem ser melhorados.

Criando e Otimizando Algoritmos em Ruby

### Talk Description
Todo dia, querendo ou não, nós criamos e seguimos algoritmos. Desde decidir que rota seguiremos de casa para o escritório a seguir uma receita enquanto cozinhamos, a vida é feita desses padrões. Esses padrões tem um significado especial quando eles precisam ser interpretados por um computador. Não importa quem interpreta os algoritmos - humanos ou máquinas - eles devem ser eficientes em velocidade e consumo de recursos. Venha e aprenda os princípios e as boas práticas de construção, avaliação e refinamento de algoritmos em Ruby. Vamos trilhar o caminho através de exemplos na vida real de criar o algoritmo principal de um jogo de combate e fantasia. Passo a passo vamos traduzir um sistema de regras complexo em um algoritmo Ruby eficiente e robusto. Você sairá da palestra com um entendimento melhor de como criar algoritmos ótimos e refatorar algoritmos existentes em seu próprio código Ruby.

80.000 Senhas em Texto Puro: Uma Estória de Amor ao Código Livre em Três Atos

### Talk Description
Considering getting a new dog? Here are some name suggestions: fluffmuffin, peppercorn, monkeybreath

Just kidding, those aren't dog name suggestions -- those are a few of our users' plaintext passwords.

Don't like any of those? Don't worry -- I have 80,000 more, and it only took me 87 seconds to gather them from our customer database in a white-hat attack.

In Act I, we'll cover the history of secure password storage, examine the hack, and mitigate the threat. Act II will address the difficulties of working on libraries with complicated dependencies (like bcrypt-ruby, of which I'm now a maintainer). In Act III, we'll celebrate the power of global collaboration via OSS.

Arquitetura distribuída: escalando projetos e times

### Talk Description
Há alguns anos, muitas pessoas diziam que Rails não escalava. Atualmente, existem muitas aplicações grandes em Rails que mostram que isso não é verdade. Mas quando seu projeto cresce, até que ponto vale manter tudo numa única aplicação? Nesta apresentação, vou mostrar detalhes de uma arquitetura distribuída com serviços, apresentando os principais pontos positivos e negativos desta abordagem. Será apresentado como exemplo o caso do projeto Globo.tv (http://globotv.globo.com/), onde utilizamos esta arquitetura para permitir que diferentes times trabalhem juntos. Mantém seu blog em http://blog.guilhermegarnier.com.

### Talk Title
O Dilema da Simplicidade

### Talk Description

Over the years we've learned to pay attention to the importance of a number of highly desirable qualities in software: readability, maintainability, adaptation to change. We've accepted these values as good and actively pursue them yet we consistently ignore what is probably the best method of achieving these qualities, it's staring us right in the face now.

Slowly but steadily the philosophy of embracing simplicity in software design by carefully calculating and minimizing unnecessary complexity is gaining traction in our community, and for a good reason: it organically pushes us to the best software practices we all know and love, it both embraces all the core principles the ruby community has developed over the years while rejecting many of the common practices we carry based on inertia but which directly contradict these values.

In this talk I explore my journey on this shift in perspective from certain fragments of our community and how thinking about simplicity as one of our core values can push us to be better developers while producing better quality of software. We don't need our crutches anymore, let's drop them together!

### Talk Title
Projeto Orientado a Domínio & NoSQL

### Talk Description
Domain Driven Design is a software development process that focuses on finding a common language for the involved parties. This language and the resulting models are taken from the domain rather than the technical details of the implementation. The goal is to improve the communication between customers, developers and all other involved groups. Even if Eric Evan's book about this topic was written almost ten years ago, this topic remains important because a lot of projects fail for communication reasons.

Relational databases have their own language and influence the design of software into a direction further away from the domain: Entities have to be created for the sole purpose of adhering to best practices of relational database. Two kinds of NoSQL databases are changing that: Document stores and graph databases. In a document store you can model a contains relation in a more natural way and thereby express if this entity can exist outside of its surrounding entity. A graph database allows you to model relationships between entities in a straight forward way that can be expressed in the language of the domain.

I want to look at the way a multi model database that combines a document store and a graph database can help you model your problems in a way that is understandable for all parties involved.

### Talk Title
Deixando Rails pelo Dropwizard?

### Talk Description
Due to the success of Rails, many successful organizations find themselves with a Rails application that needs partitioning. Many organizations have chosen to largely abandon Ruby during this transition, yet the reasoning is often reactionary.
 
This talk explores the approach Yammer has taken, comparing Rails and the Java-based Dropwizard framework.  Both have the mantra of getting decision-making and repetition out of the way so you can get things done.  Dropwizard takes a slightly different approach by putting emphasis on "production-ready out-of-the-box." 
 
In this talk, attendees will gain insights into the options Rubyists have for replicating Dropwizard's ops-focus in Rails.  Attendees will also come away with an understanding of why Dropwizard's focus on operations and metrics makes it appealing to organizations tearing apart their monolithic Rails application. By assembling similar toolsets for Ruby and Java services, we'll be better positioned to choose between them on the merits of the stack and language.

Evoluindo Sistemas Distribuídos

### Talk Description
Distributed systems are big, in every sense of the word. From the biggest social networks and search engines to the simplest web or iOS application, distributed software causes problems, stemming from its greatest feature: the system should continue working even when parts break.

Client applications without network connections still want to capture data, backends with a failed service or two shouldn't break the entire application, and the app should still mostly work even when the big datacenter (you know the one) goes down.

How do you grow a simple monolithic Rails app into a distributed system? What does it take to make your UI save data for a network connection later? How do you even test all this stuff?

I'll be presenting a survey of concepts, architectures, and experiences, with a few tools that make distributed systems less obtuse.

Adotando SOA a partir do Dia 1

### Talk Description
In this workshop, we'll explain what a service-oriented architecture is, its advantages, and the reasons why developers should think about it when starting an application. I'll go into how complex and expensive it is to move to SOA when applications reach a specific code base size, traffic load, and will argue that using a SOA in an early stage of development is a feasible solution. We'll build a set of services and front-end applications to put into practice all the theory discussed in the workshop. We'll give parts of the workshop in Portuguese and English.

Codificando em Produção

### Talk Description
Ever had that bug that happens "only in production"? Ever heard someone say "but it works on my machine"? Ever said it yourself? Wouldn't it be nice if you could write all your code directly in production - so that when it works for you on your machine, it also works for everyone else?

In this workshop we will build a virtual environment which replicates a production environment from scratch using configuration automation and virtualization through lightweight containers. With our trusty tools, Vagrant, Docker and Chef- we will proceed step by step to build a local development environment.

With this, we hope to highlight the benefits of being able to see locally how code would actually work in production - helping catch design issues quickly and eliminate entire classes of bugs. Plus, to be honest, it also gives us a chance to play around with some really fun tech.

Eu Preciso de Velocidade

### Talk Description
From time to time, when building Ruby apps, you realise there are no libraries available for what you need. Even worse, Ruby doesn't quite perform as quickly as we would expect in certain areas. There are, however, a lot of high performance, mature technologies built in C that can easily be ported to be used with Ruby. By doing this, we get to keep using our favourite language, opening it to a plethora of applications that were not possible before, and still keep things snappy.

In this talk, I will walk you through the ins and outs of building Spyglass, an OpenCV binding for Ruby. I will also talk in detail about some gotchas (memory management, lack of threading), good practices (C objects as first class citizens, how to properly test extensions), why mkmf needs to be retired and some great examples of extensions you probably already use and should be looking at.

### Talk Title
Encontre Simplicidade com Plain Old Ruby Objects

### Talk Description
This talk will discuss why you might, when you set out to design a system, want to stop thinking about persistence. Rather than kicking off a project generating models that subclass `ActiveRecord::Base`, I will suggest beginning your application development by modelling behaviour with *Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs)*.

While including ideas from [Avdi Grimm]'s [Objects on Rails], the talk will primarily be based around my personal experience refactoring an-ActiveResource based system with Plain Old Ruby Objects and [roar].

Included in this talk will be an exploration of:

- patterns, such as [Repository] and [Data Mapper], as coined by Martin Fowler,
- how upcoming libraries - Curator, DataMappify, ROM.rb and Veritas - fit in with these patterns,
- the parts of these libraries that are EUAble today,
- how to make this methodology workable in the context of TDD (keeping components as testable as possible).

There will also be a discussion about the stage when you should begin implementing persistence.

Experiências Perdidas - Sendo Lean sem Perder o Encanto

### Talk Description
Over time engineers have developed best practices and tools for identifying and managing technical debt, designers must do the same. Design debt can be just as dangerous for the businesses we work for and yet it is often ignored as teams transition to lightweight methodologies like Agile, Scrum, Lean, or Kanban.

Shorter iterations do not automatically lead to better outcomes. Lean UX can leave in it's wake a wasteland of broken experiences littered with tumbleweeds never to be swept up. In this presentation Samuel Bowles will tell stories, and provide practical tools from his experience applying Lean principles to reduce waste while preserving delight.

As Taiichi Ohno, the father of the Toyota Production System, rightly warned—Lean methods improperly applied “cause a variety of problems”. In this talk we will explore a number of these pitfalls and potential solutions for how we can avoid them as a balanced team of designers, developers, and business stakeholders.
