      <h3 id="porto-de-galinhas">Porto de Galinhas</h3>
      <span class="icon icon-left icon-porto"></span><p>In 2014, Abril Pro Ruby is heading to Porto de Galinhas, an outstanding beach located 37 mi south of the city of Recife, Pernambuco. The location is known for its impressive landscapes and beautiful nature.</p>
      <p>Until a few years ago, Porto was an anonymous small village of fishermen, but nowadays it is one of the most important tourist destinations in Brazil, being elected ten times in a row the best beach of the country. In spite of that, the village is still small and it managed to keep its distinctive rustic fishermen architecture.</p>
      <p>The beach line is 11 mi long, all with white, fine grained, clean sand. There is a chain of millenary reefs lining all along the coast. During the lower tide, the water trapped by the reefs form several natural pools where people can swim, dive and feed the fishes in an average water temperature of 78 °F for the year.</p>

      <h4>How to get there</h4>
      <p>If you're coming by air, you should land in the Recife/Guararapes International Airport (REC). It services trips from almost every Brazilian state and also operates flights from USA and Europe. From there, you can take a bus, use a shuttle service, get a taxi or rent a car to go to Porto de Galinhas (the trip between Recife and Porto usually takes 2 hours).</p>
      <p>If you're in a nearby state, you can also come by bus or even drive directly to the beach. Additionally, Abril Pro Ruby will provide free transportation for attendees from Recife to Porto de Galinhas in the day of the conference.</p>

      <h3 id="venue">The Venue</h3>
      <span class="icon icon-right icon-map"></span><p>The conference will take place in <strong>Hotel Armação</strong>, a beautiful resort that sits right by the edge of the sea. The hotel is offering special package deals for AP.Rb attendants (remember to mention you're coming for the conference when booking your reservation).</p>
